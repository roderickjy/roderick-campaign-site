<p class="stage">(A single lantern. The Waikato River murmurs. The CHORUS OF SCRUTINEERS enter with clipboards, wearing hi-vis cloaks.)</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CHORUS.</span>
Good folk of Kirikiriroa, hearken near—<br/>
The scrolls are sealed, the numbers crisp and clear.<br/>
This tale is ink’d from preliminary counts,<br/>
Of mayor crown’d, and wards with STV amounts.<br/>
<span class="stage">(Waggles a parchment)</span><br/>
Here writ the quotas, keeps, surpluses set free;<br/>
Our page, the returning officer’s decree.

Sweet as, team—pre-lim-i-nar-y. If your cousin reckons the final’s different, he’s not wrong—he’s just… early.

<h2 id="h-act-i">Act I – Super Saturday &amp; The Chain of Office</h2>
<h3>Victoria on the River. A chalkboard reads: “Count in Progress. No pies on the stage.” Sea mist, gumboots, and clipboards.</h3>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CHORUS.</span>
Behold the box where tick and hope do dwell;<br/>
From urn to pile to spreadsheet’s patient cell.<br/>
One crown there is, and many heads contend;<br/>
At last, the count draws near its welcome end.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CLERK OF QUOTAS</span> <span class="aside">(ringing a bell)</span>
Iteration Nine! Quota met! Surplus released!<br/>
By lawful reckoning and transfer’d feast—<br/>
TIMUS MACINDOE ascends the mayoral seat.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">BILLY T’S SPIRIT.</span>
Oi, Timus, you’ve got more votes than sausages at a Bunnings on payday. Don’t trip on the chain, cuz—heavy is the korowai that hugs the neck.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">TIMUS.</span>
If grace be measure, let my measure flow;<br/>
The city’s debts we’ll tame, its gardens grow.<br/>
Yet mark the ledger—where the city leans,<br/>
I’ll walk the line ’twixt prudence and our dreams.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">SARAH OF THE WEST</span> <span class="aside">(aside, warm)</span>
So falls the chain to him; yet still we strive,<br/>
For council’s craft needs many hands alive.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">RODERICK THE SCRIBE</span> <span class="aside">(entering with a grin)</span>
And some hands wave, some rest—’tis sport to try.<br/>
If not the seat, then still the city’s cry.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CHORUS.</span>
Now to the wards we step, where quotas sing,<br/>
And keep-values, like wine, from casks we bring!

<h2 id="h-act-ii">Act II – The East Counts Itself Twice</h2>
<h3>The Rotunda of the East Ward. On a trestle: six cups labelled “Quota.” A seventh, cheeky cup labelled “Timus (again?)”.</h3>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CLERK OF QUOTAS.</span>
In East the tide ran full: six cups brim o’er—<br/>
RACHEL OF THE EAST, ANNA, ANDREW, JAMIE, LEO—and…<br/>
<span class="aside">(eyebrows)</span> TIMUS? Ho! Can one man sit in twain?
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">BILLY T’S SPIRIT.</span>
Mean as a school tuck shop, eh—buy one mayor, get one councillor free! Nah, jokes: rules will sort it. Transfers, whānau. Paperwork’s coming in hot like a meat pie.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">RACHEL OF THE EAST.</span>
If fate should move and Tim to mayor tend,<br/>
Then East by count-back finds another friend.<br/>
We honour votes; we honour lawful flow—<br/>
The river gives, the river says who’ll row.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">ANNA CASEY-COX.</span>
The commons call—let shade and stream be guide.<br/>
A council serves by keeping rivers wide.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">ANDREW BYDDER.</span>
On figures, friends, our village rises straight;<br/>
A tidy book keeps tidy city’s fate.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">JAMIE STRANGE.</span>
From Beehive floors to Garden Place’s breeze,<br/>
I’ll learn anew the local’s subtleties.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">LEO LIU.</span>
To traders, tenants, builders—ni hao, kia ora—<br/>
The path is smoother where the sums are surer.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CLERK OF QUOTAS</span> <span class="aside">(pouring a cup back into others)</span>
Surplus, redistribute! A quiet art—<br/>
The spreadsheet is our second beating heart.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CHORUS.</span>
Thus East is framed—six chairs and one spare laugh;<br/>
When mayors wear two hats, the law picks half.

<h2 id="h-act-iii">Act III – West: The Hammer, The Heart, and The Near-Misses</h2>
<h3>A saw-horse, a builder’s pencil, a school crossing flag. The West Ward feels like a Saturday working bee.</h3>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CLERK OF QUOTAS.</span>
Make way for West! Six pou to stand in line:<br/>
GEOFF OF THE QUILL, SARAH OF THE WEST, GRAEME MEAD, MESH,<br/>
ANGELA O’LEARY, EMMA PIKE—these six enmesh.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">GEOFF OF THE QUILL.</span>
A city writes itself with every rate;<br/>
We’ll spell it well, and spell it not too late.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">SARAH OF THE WEST.</span>
Let safety stitch our roads where children go;<br/>
And buses keep their promise, not just show.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">GRAEME MEAD.</span>
A steady hand on ledger, debt, and plan—<br/>
Where wish meets budget, choose what truly can.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">MESH</span> <span class="aside">(sleeves rolled, grinning)</span>
Right, team: the jobs list’s long—kerbs, footpaths, drains—<br/>
We’ll swing the hammer ’til the squeak complains.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">ANGELA O’LEARY.</span>
Institution’s memory, a living chart;<br/>
If walls could talk, I’d ask them where to start.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">EMMA PIKE.</span>
New eyes to see what old eyes sometimes miss;<br/>
Fresh air through chambers—kia kaha to this.
</p>

<p class="stage">(At the wing, MARK FLYGER, LOUISE HUTT, MICHAEL WEST, DAVE TAYLOR hover, offering nods. Then PAUL THE PATHFINDER and RODERICK THE SCRIBE step into a soft pool of light.)</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">PAUL THE PATHFINDER</span> <span class="aside">(to Roderick, kind)</span>
We cast our hats; the wind blew where it chose.<br/>
Not yet today—but still, the river flows.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">RODERICK THE SCRIBE</span> <span class="aside">(with a grin and a shrug)</span>
Aye, cuz. We spoke our piece, we kept it brave;<br/>
If not the dais, then the next wee wave.<br/>
The city’s bigger than a single chair—<br/>
I’ll print more flyers, bro. I’ll still be there.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">BILLY T’S SPIRIT</span> <span class="aside">(nudging them both)</span>
That’s the yarn! Lose the count, keep the kaupapa. You fellas bring a thermos to every hui—mean service.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CHORUS.</span>
So West stands set, the six with shoulders square;<br/>
And those set down still shoulder civic care.

<h2 id="h-act-iv">Act IV – He Tautoko: Kirikiriroa Māori Ward &amp; The Great Poll</h2>
<h3>A slow pūtātara call. A woven mat. Two seats are placed with reverence.</h3>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CHORUS.</span>
Karawhiua—two seats for Māori voice to hold;<br/>
The river hears in reo, clear and bold.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CLERK OF QUOTAS.</span>
First count! MARIA HUATA—first across the tide.<br/>
And next, by measured flow, ROBBIE NEHA beside.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">MARIA HUATA.</span>
Not crown alone but burden shared we wear,<br/>
To bind the city’s promises to care.<br/>
The harakeke is strong where centre lies,<br/>
Where rito’s safe, the outer leaf replies.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">ROBBIE NEHA.</span>
We’ll ask with mana, answer with respect;<br/>
And where there’s hurt, we’ll choose to reconnect.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">BILLY T’S SPIRIT</span> <span class="aside">(softly)</span>
Ae mārika. Two seats, two ears—listen first, then talk. Mean.
</p>

<p class="stage">(Another scroll is lifted—marked “Poll.”)</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CLERK OF QUOTAS.</span>
And citizens have voted on the ward itself:<br/>
“To keep” the Māori wards—aye, ka mau te wehi—prevails;<br/>
“To remove” spoke near, but could not shift the scales.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CHORUS.</span>
Thus spake the city, river-long and wide:<br/>
To keep the door, and welcome who abide.

<h2 id="h-act-v">Act V – The Redistribution &amp; The River’s Oath</h2>
<h3>A council chamber imagined: a blend of Garden Place and a marae ātea. A long table. A whiteboard that reads “Surplus, Quota, Keep-Value, Action.”</h3>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CLERK OF QUOTAS</span> <span class="aside">(setting down the final ledger)</span>
What once was many flows to settle’d few;<br/>
The maths is done—but now the making’s due.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">TIMUS.</span>
If once I stood in two halls counted true,<br/>
I’ll seek the one my oath compels me to.<br/>
Let East receive by law the next in line;<br/>
A mayor’s lot is single, stern, and fine.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">RACHEL OF THE EAST.</span>
Let bridges bind the halves across the flood;<br/>
One city, not two fiefs of coal and mud.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">SARAH OF THE WEST.</span>
We’ll count the children home by safer street;<br/>
And measure wins by humble pairs of feet.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">GEOFF OF THE QUILL.</span>
The words we pass shall marry purse and plan;<br/>
Where numbers sing, there proudly stands a span.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">MARIA HUATA.</span>
Te Tiriti’s chord—let council pluck it true;<br/>
A harmony of old and brave of new.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">ROBBIE NEHA.</span>
Where seats are earned, responsibilities wake;<br/>
We’ll show by deeds the promises we make.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">MESH.</span>
Righto—enough kōrero to warm a shed.<br/>
Let’s pick the spades and sort the drains ahead.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">ANGELA O’LEARY.</span>
And mind the bylaws—keep the waka straight;<br/>
We’ll make the timetables cooperate.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">EMMA PIKE.</span>
Consult, not tick; include, not merely note;<br/>
A quieter city is a better vote.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">GRAEME MEAD.</span>
Pay what we must, not more, and not too late;<br/>
A careful ledger is a civic trait.
</p>

<p class="stage">(A gentle hush. RODERICK THE SCRIBE steps forward with a folded flag of the river.)</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">RODERICK THE SCRIBE.</span>
I lost the count but found the fellowship;<br/>
I’ll be the citizen who will not slip.<br/>
I’ll stand at VOTR on a breezy morn,<br/>
Pour tea, hear stories, help new visions born.<br/>
For city-making is a longer race<br/>
Than single nights of numbers’ hot embrace.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">BILLY T’S SPIRIT</span> <span class="aside">(beaming)</span>
Chur, that’s the mahi. Council in the room, people in the square, kids on the bus, aunties at the shops—everyone’s in the cast. Now, somebody put on a brew.
</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="speaker">CHORUS.</span>
The count is ink’d, the names upon the roll;<br/>
But ink is naught without a common soul.<br/>
From ballots cast to footpaths mended clean,<br/>
Let Aotearoa’s craft be plainly seen.<br/>
So ends our play—yet truly, it begins:<br/>
With you, with us, with honest daily wins.
