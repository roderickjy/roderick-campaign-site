  <h2>üìà The Challenge ‚Äì and the Opportunity</h2>
  <p>Hamilton is projected to grow by <strong>205,400 people by 2030</strong>. To manage this surge, we must plan smartly ‚Äî protecting our communities, our environment, and our local budgets.</p>

  <h2>üö´ The Problem with Urban Sprawl</h2>
  <p>Urban sprawl inflates costs for roads, pipes, and services ‚Äî pushing rates onto existing residents. That‚Äôs not fair. <strong>Build Forward proposes a 95% infill, 5% sprawl strategy.</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Build up, not out</li>
    <li>Retrofit and intensify underused properties</li>
    <li>Enable rooftop tents and backyard dwellings as safe, transitional housing</li>
    <li>Fast-track multi-family units, co-housing and townhouses</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üè® From Roof Tents to Hotels</h2>
  <p>We need a flexible housing ladder:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rooftop tents and short-term backyard cabins</li>
    <li>Legalised garage conversions and granny flats</li>
    <li>Mid-rise apartments near transit</li>
    <li>2‚Äì3 new hotels for visitors and professionals</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üßì Protecting Ratepayers on Fixed Incomes</h2>
  <p>Our long-term ratepayers shouldn‚Äôt be squeezed to fund growth. We can shift the burden:</p>

  <h3>üí∞ Bank Interest = Local Rates</h3>
  <p>If an overseas bank collects <strong>$100,000 in interest</strong> per year from a Hamilton mortgage, then <strong>$4,000 of that should support our city</strong>.</p>
  <p>This ensures fair contributions without raising rates on pensioners, single parents, or wage earners.</p>

  <h2>üèóÔ∏è Smart Growth Funding</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Introduce a <strong>Financial Transaction Levy</strong> on overseas mortgage profits</li>
    <li>Offer <strong>half-price LIM reports</strong> to stimulate safe sales and smart subdivisions</li>
    <li>Maintain a <strong>Rates Cap</strong> for fixed-income households</li>
    <li>Embed <strong>co-governance and local values</strong> in infrastructure decisions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üîç Summary Table</h2>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Strategy</th>
        <th>Outcome</th>
      </tr>

      <h1>Notes from the Hamilton West Residents & Ratepayers Forum</h1>
      <p class="byline">By Roderick J. Young, Independent Candidate ‚Äì Hamilton West</p>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p class="lede">
        Nine of us stood up last night, 27th August 2025, out of the 16 candidates running for six West Ward seats. That fact alone was telling:
        fewer than two-thirds turned up, but it was enough to give the audience a flavour of the race and the different paths
        Hamilton might take.
      </p>

      <p>
        I spoke second, and my 180 seconds went quickly. I decided to use the time to explain <abbr title="Single Transferable Vote">STV</abbr> ‚Äî the Single Transferable Vote system ‚Äî which confuses many voters. I kept it simple:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Imagine 12 mayoral candidates, each starting with about 8% on the first preference.</li>
        <li>By the second preference, four candidates pick up more votes.</li>
        <li>At the third, it narrows further.</li>
        <li>By the fourth, one candidate has the numbers and is elected.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It landed well. Tony, from Residents and Ratepayers, later said he had been waiting months for a plain explanation from staff.
        My sense is the room appreciated someone taking the time to translate technical detail into everyday language.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Stood Out</h2>
      <p>
        The night had its winners. Mesh earned respect for speaking clearly to the audience‚Äôs concerns. Too many others leaned on accountant-style jargon,
        facts piled on facts until people tuned out. 3 candidates trying to out-number each other with financial spreadsheets didn‚Äôt shift the mood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sarah and Emma both spoke strongly. Emma made a point that resonated: half of Hamilton‚Äôs population is under 30.
        Roderick J Young's idea that each councillor should appoint six youth advisors ‚Äî three male, three female, across English, te reo MƒÅori,
        and New Zealand Sign Language ‚Äî felt fresh and practical.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sarah took issue with claims that 25% of rates are going to debt interest, saying it‚Äôs closer to 13%.
        But she also defended more billion-dollar spending on the Pukete wastewater treatment plant.
        That‚Äôs a hard sell in a city already carrying $1.3 billion in debt, costing households over $1,000 a year in interest payments alone.
      </p>

      <h2>Leadership Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Tim was asked about the CEO‚Äôs five-year contract. He declined to answer from the back of the hall, saying it wasn‚Äôt appropriate.
        Later he also pushed back against a suggestion that the CEO be paid less than the Mayor ‚Äî I had argued for councillors and leadership
        to set the example by tightening pay. Tim cut in, saying bluntly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>‚ÄúIt cannot be done.‚Äù</blockquote>
      <p>
        That moment drew a reaction; the room could sense the division between councillors who defend the status quo and those of us asking for change.
      </p>

      <h2>Cameras and Conversations</h2>
      <p>
        There was even drama around the recording of the event. The official videographer packed up mid-session. A woman who arrived late began filming on her phone,
        later asking Tony if her footage could be entered into the official record because ‚Äúit was so interesting.‚Äù It shows the hunger in the community
        for transparency and open records.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the official close, five of us stayed behind, talking with residents for another 20 minutes. It grew colder, and rain was forecast for the next four days,
        but people lingered ‚Äî proof that Hamiltonians want more than speeches; they want conversations.
      </p>

      <h2>The Reality Beneath the Debate</h2>
      <p>As I listened to my fellow candidates, I kept thinking about the bigger picture:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Debt:</strong> Hamilton‚Äôs $1.3 billion burden is among the highest in New Zealand per capita.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Our population has passed 185,000 and is rising faster than any other metro, heading to 200,000 by 2030.</li>
        <li><strong>Youth:</strong> Half of us are under 30 ‚Äî Hamilton is a young city, with a median age of just 32 compared to the national 37.</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> The Pukete upgrade alone is expected to run over $600 million, on top of Peacocke and other growth-linked borrowing.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Council‚Äôs own surveys show confidence in decision-making has dropped below 25%.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These aren‚Äôt abstract numbers. They shape whether families can afford their rates, whether young people see a future here,
        whether small businesses thrive, and whether Hamilton‚Äôs money stays in Hamilton ‚Äî or keeps leaking offshore.
      </p>

      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        From my notes, two things stand out. First, Hamilton voters are desperate for clarity. They want the fog of jargon lifted so they can judge for themselves.
        Second, they want leadership that looks beyond short-term fixes and begins building long-term resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The forum ended with no clear ‚Äúwinner‚Äù ‚Äî but for me, the most important outcome was the energy in the room.
        Ratepayers are paying attention, asking sharper questions, and demanding answers. That is a healthy sign for democracy in our city.
      </p>

        Incumbents return, the ledger stays heavy,<br>
