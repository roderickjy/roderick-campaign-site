  <h1>Build Forward: Hamilton’s Growth Plan</h1>
  <p>Housing New Residents Without Punishing the Rest. 2023 Approximately 183,000 residents,

2028 Approximately 194,400 residents,

  <h2>📈 The Challenge – and the Opportunity</h2>
  <p>Hamilton is projected to grow by <strong>30,000 people by 2030</strong>. To manage this surge, we must plan smartly — protecting our communities, our environment, and our local budgets.</p>

  <h2>🚫 The Problem with Urban Sprawl</h2>
  <p>Urban sprawl inflates costs for roads, pipes, and services — pushing rates onto existing residents. That’s not fair. <strong>Build Forward proposes a 95% infill, 5% sprawl strategy.</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Build up, not out</li>
    <li>Retrofit and intensify underused properties</li>
    <li>Enable rooftop tents and backyard dwellings as safe, transitional housing</li>
    <li>Fast-track multi-family units, co-housing and townhouses</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🏨 From Roof Tents to Hotels</h2>
  <p>We need a flexible housing ladder:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rooftop tents and short-term backyard cabins</li>
    <li>Legalised garage conversions and granny flats</li>
    <li>Mid-rise apartments near transit</li>
    <li>2–3 new hotels for visitors and professionals</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧓 Protecting Ratepayers on Fixed Incomes</h2>
  <p>Our long-term ratepayers shouldn’t be squeezed to fund growth. We can shift the burden:</p>

  <h3>💰 Bank Interest = Local Rates</h3>
  <p>If an overseas bank collects <strong>$100,000 in interest</strong> per year from a Hamilton mortgage, then <strong>$4,000 of that should support our city</strong>.</p>
  <p>This ensures fair contributions without raising rates on pensioners, single parents, or wage earners.</p>

  <h2>🏗️ Smart Growth Funding</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Introduce a <strong>Financial Transaction Levy</strong> on overseas mortgage profits</li>
    <li>Offer <strong>half-price LIM reports</strong> to stimulate safe sales and smart subdivisions</li>
    <li>Maintain a <strong>Rates Cap</strong> for fixed-income households</li>
    <li>Embed <strong>co-governance and local values</strong> in infrastructure decisions</li>
  </ul>

      <h1>Notes from the Hamilton West Residents & Ratepayers Forum</h1>
      <p class="byline">By Roderick J. Young, Independent Candidate – Hamilton West</p>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p class="lede">
        Nine of us stood up last night, 27th August 2025, out of the 16 candidates running for six West Ward seats. That fact alone was telling:
        fewer than two-thirds turned up, but it was enough to give the audience a flavour of the race and the different paths
        Hamilton might take.
      </p>

      <p>
        I spoke second, and my 180 seconds went quickly. I decided to use the time to explain <abbr title="Single Transferable Vote">STV</abbr> — the Single Transferable Vote system — which confuses many voters. I kept it simple:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Imagine 12 mayoral candidates, each starting with about 8% on the first preference.</li>
        <li>By the second preference, four candidates pick up more votes.</li>
        <li>At the third, it narrows further.</li>
        <li>By the fourth, one candidate has the numbers and is elected.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It landed well. Tony, from Residents and Ratepayers, later said he had been waiting months for a plain explanation from staff.
        My sense is the room appreciated someone taking the time to translate technical detail into everyday language.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Stood Out</h2>
      <p>
        The night had its winners. Mesh earned respect for speaking clearly to the audience’s concerns. Too many others leaned on accountant-style jargon,
        facts piled on facts until people tuned out. 3 candidates trying to out-number each other with financial spreadsheets didn’t shift the mood.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sarah and Emma both spoke strongly. Emma made a point that resonated: half of Hamilton’s population is under 30.
        Roderick J Young's idea that each councillor should appoint six youth advisors — three male, three female, across English, te reo Māori,
        and New Zealand Sign Language — felt fresh and practical.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sarah took issue with claims that 25% of rates are going to debt interest, saying it’s closer to 13%.
        But she also defended more billion-dollar spending on the Pukete wastewater treatment plant.
        That’s a hard sell in a city already carrying $1.3 billion in debt, costing households over $1,000 a year in interest payments alone.
      </p>

      <h2>Leadership Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Tim was asked about the CEO’s five-year contract. He declined to answer from the back of the hall, saying it wasn’t appropriate.
        Later he also pushed back against a suggestion that the CEO be paid less than the Mayor — I had argued for councillors and leadership
        to set the example by tightening pay. Tim cut in, saying bluntly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>“It cannot be done.”</blockquote>
      <p>
        That moment drew a reaction; the room could sense the division between councillors who defend the status quo and those of us asking for change.
      </p>

      <h2>Cameras and Conversations</h2>
      <p>
        There was even drama around the recording of the event. The official videographer packed up mid-session. A woman who arrived late began filming on her phone,
        later asking Tony if her footage could be entered into the official record because “it was so interesting.” It shows the hunger in the community
        for transparency and open records.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the official close, five of us stayed behind, talking with residents for another 20 minutes. It grew colder, and rain was forecast for the next four days,
        but people lingered — proof that Hamiltonians want more than speeches; they want conversations.
      </p>

      <h2>The Reality Beneath the Debate</h2>
      <p>As I listened to my fellow candidates, I kept thinking about the bigger picture:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Debt:</strong> Hamilton’s $1.3 billion burden is among the highest in New Zealand per capita.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Our population has passed 185,000 and is rising faster than any other metro, heading to 200,000 by 2030.</li>
        <li><strong>Youth:</strong> Half of us are under 30 — Hamilton is a young city, with a median age of just 32 compared to the national 37.</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> The Pukete upgrade alone is expected to run over $600 million, on top of Peacocke and other growth-linked borrowing.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Council’s own surveys show confidence in decision-making has dropped below 25%.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These aren’t abstract numbers. They shape whether families can afford their rates, whether young people see a future here,
        whether small businesses thrive, and whether Hamilton’s money stays in Hamilton — or keeps leaking offshore.
      </p>

      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        From my notes, two things stand out. First, Hamilton voters are desperate for clarity. They want the fog of jargon lifted so they can judge for themselves.
        Second, they want leadership that looks beyond short-term fixes and begins building long-term resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The forum ended with no clear “winner” — but for me, the most important outcome was the energy in the room.
        Ratepayers are paying attention, asking sharper questions, and demanding answers. That is a healthy sign for democracy in our city.
      </p>

  <h1>How STV Works: Hamilton West Example</h1>

  <p>Let's walk through how <strong>STV (Single Transferable Vote)</strong> would work in your <strong>Hamilton West</strong> example with <strong>16 candidates</strong> competing for <strong>6 seats</strong> and only <strong>100 voters</strong>.</p>

  <h2>1. The Quota</h2>

  <p>STV uses the <strong>Droop quota</strong> formula:</p>

  <pre><code>Quota = ⌊ Total Valid Votes / (Seats + 1) ⌋ + 1</code></pre>

  <p>Here:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Total valid votes = 100</li>
    <li>Seats = 6</li>
  </ul>

  <p>So:</p>
  <pre><code>Quota = ⌊ 100 / 7 ⌋ + 1 = ⌊ 14.28 ⌋ + 1 = 15</code></pre>

  <div class="highlight">
    <span class="emoji">👉</span> <strong>So, a candidate needs 15 votes to be elected.</strong>
  </div>

  <h2>2. First Preferences</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All 100 voters rank the 16 candidates.</li>
    <li>First preferences are counted.</li>
    <li>Any candidate with 15 or more first-choice votes is immediately elected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Surplus Transfers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If a candidate has more than 15 votes (say 20), the surplus (5 votes) is redistributed to the next preferences of those 20 ballots.</li>
    <li>Redistribution is done <strong>proportionally</strong>: each of the 20 ballots transfers at a fraction of its value (5 ÷ 20 = 0.25 of a vote each).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Eliminations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If after surpluses are transferred, fewer than 6 candidates have reached quota, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated.</li>
    <li>Their ballots are transferred to the next preference still in the race.</li>
    <li>This process repeats (surpluses redistributed, lowest eliminated) until 6 candidates have reached the quota.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Small Numbers Effect</h2>
  <p>Because only 100 people are voting:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The quota is low (15 votes), so a well-organised campaign could secure a seat with the support of just 15% of voters.</li>
    <li>With 16 candidates, it’s very likely many will be eliminated early because they’ll get only 1–4 votes.</li>
    <li>Preferences become crucial — if your supporters rank you 1st but also give good 2nd and 3rd preferences, you stay in the count longer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Example Outcome (Illustrative Only)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Suppose candidates A, B, and C each get 20 votes. They’re all elected (with surplus transferred).</li>
    <li>Candidates D and E get 16 and 15 votes — also elected.</li>
    <li>Now 5 seats are filled.</li>
    <li>The remaining 11 candidates share 29 votes. The weakest are eliminated until one last candidate passes quota.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight">
    ✅ <strong>Bottom line:</strong> In Hamilton West with 100 voters, 16 candidates, and 6 seats, the winning threshold is 15 votes. Success depends not just on first preferences but on building broad support through lower-order rankings, since eliminated candidates’ votes can decide the final seat.

  <h1>The Droop Quota of Kirikiriroa</h1>
  <p><em>A civic comedy in one act, blending Shakespearean flourish with Billy T James’ cheek.</em></p>

  <h2>Dramatis Personae</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>CHORUS OF KIRIKIRIROA</strong> – the Waikato River, flowing and knowing.</li>
    <li><strong>BILLY THE JESTER</strong> – A Billy T James–style MC, cheeky and musical.</li>
    <li><strong>RETURNING OFFICER</strong> – solemn clerk with scrolls, loves rules.</li>
    <li><strong>A, B, C, D</strong> – funnel candidates, hopeful and scheming.</li>
    <li><strong>E–L</strong> – the other eight, loud but short-lived.</li>
    <li><strong>NANA RATEPAYER</strong> – guardian of wallets, quick to heckle.</li>
    <li><strong>THE QUOTA</strong> – a ghostly figure, always “51”.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scene I – At the Counting Hall</h2>
  <p class="stage-direction">[Enter CHORUS OF KIRIKIRIROA, flowing robes like blue water.]</p>
  <p class="character">CHORUS:</p>
  <p>
    Hear now the tale of ballots cast,<br>
    Of twelve who sought the mayoral crown.<br>
    A hundred voices, small yet vast,<br>
    And only one to wear the gown.
  </p>

  <h2>Scene II – The First Preferences</h2>
  <p class="stage-direction">[Enter BILLY THE JESTER with guitar, strums a cheeky riff.]</p>
  <p class="character">BILLY:</p>
  <p>
    Kia ora whānau! Hundred folks showed up,<br>
    Dropped their ticks like coins in the pub.<br>
    Each fella gets eight, nine, maybe ten —<br>
    Not enough! Quota says: “Try again.”
  </p>
  <p class="stage-direction">[RETURNING OFFICER unrolls scroll.]</p>
  <p class="character">RETURNING OFFICER:</p>
  <p>
    The quota be fifty-one!<br>
    No soul yet crown’d, the count goes on.
  </p>
  <p class="stage-direction">[E–L strut, puffed up.]</p>
  <p class="character">E–L (together):</p>
  <p>
    Eight votes apiece, we’re doing fine!
  </p>
  <p class="character aside">BILLY (aside, to audience):</p>
  <p>
    Yeah, fine like a waka with a hole in the line…
  </p>

  <h2>Scene III – The Funnel Awakens</h2>
  <p class="stage-direction">[As E–L are struck out, their votes fly like ghostly ballots to A, B, C, D.]</p>
  <p class="character">CHORUS:</p>
  <p>
    One by one the weak are slain,<br>
    Their second loves must take the gain.<br>
    See now A, B, C, D grow,<br>
    Fed by rivers from below.
  </p>
  <p class="stage-direction">[A swells in stature.]</p>
  <p class="character">A:</p>
  <p>
    From humble nine I rise to three-and-thirty!<br>
    A funnel bless’d, my basket never empty.
  </p>
  <p class="character">B:</p>
  <p>
    I too climb, yet lag behind.
  </p>
  <p class="character">C &amp; D:</p>
  <p>
    We taste the quota, but our fate’s unkind.
  </p>

  <h2>Scene IV – Eliminations Tighten</h2>
  <p class="stage-direction">[D is eliminated; scrolls vanish to A and B.]</p>
  <p class="character">RETURNING OFFICER:</p>
  <p>
    D is gone, their sev’nt’n votes away,<br>
    Flow unto A and B, as rivers stray.
  </p>
  <p class="character">BILLY (grins):</p>
  <p>
    That’s politics, eh? One day you’re in,<br>
    Next day you’re the kai for your cousin’s win.
  </p>
  <p class="stage-direction">[C too is felled, sending his votes down the funnel.]</p>
  <p class="character">A (towering):</p>
  <p>
    Lo! I am fill’d, beyond the measure,<br>
    Fifty-six souls proclaim their treasure.
  </p>

  <h2>Scene V – The Quota Crowned</h2>
  <p class="stage-direction">[Enter THE QUOTA, glowing with the number 51 across chest.]</p>
  <p class="character">THE QUOTA:</p>
  <p>
    Thou hast surpass’d me, Candidate A.<br>
    The mayoral chair is thine this day.
  </p>
  <p class="character">CHORUS:</p>
  <p>
    So through the funnel, narrow, neat,<br>
    The river carried one to seat.<br>
    Though many stood, though loud they cried,<br>
    Transfers crown’d the one supplied.
  </p>

  <h2>Epilogue – Billy’s Send-off</h2>
  <p class="character">BILLY:</p>
  <p>
    And that’s the moral, folks, don’t moan —<br>
    It’s not just your first tick that wins the throne.<br>
    In Kirikiriroa, the trick is plain:<br>
    Keep ranking the boxes, aye, all the way down the chain.
  </p>
  <p class="stage-direction">[He strums a final cheeky waiata riff.]</p>
  <p class="character">BILLY (sings):</p>
  <p>
    From twelve down to one, the quota did run,<br>
    Fifty-one votes and the mayor’s job’s done!

<section id="rates-postponement">
<h2>1. Rates Postponement for Hardship <span class="badge">Fairness</span></h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Enable cash-poor, house-rich residents (e.g., elderly homeowners) to defer rates without financial distress, preserving homeownership while ensuring council revenue.</p>

<h3>Policy Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Homeowners with rates bills exceeding 10% of household income qualify for postponement. Priority for seniors, pensioners, and low-income households.</li>
<li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Deferred rates accrue as a statutory charge on the property title, payable upon sale or transfer. Interest capped at a transparent, market-aligned rate (e.g., 1% above inflation, reviewed annually).</li>
<li><strong>Outreach:</strong> Automatic screening triggers a plain-English letter offering postponement when rates exceed 10% of income. Includes clear terms and a contact for support.</li>
<li><strong>Review:</strong> Annual reassessment of eligibility to ensure fairness and prevent surprises.</li>
<li><strong>Metrics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Track applications, approvals, arrears reduction, and forced sales avoided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Codify in council bylaws within 6 months.</li>
<li>Allocate budget for outreach staff (2 FTEs) and system updates.</li>
<li>Publish quarterly stats on postponements granted and financial impact.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="docs-access">
<h2>2. Accessible Document Services (Copy/Scan/Send) <span class="badge">Opportunity</span></h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Ensure job-seekers and residents can access essential document services (photocopying, scanning, emailing) without bureaucratic barriers, supporting employment and opportunity.</p>

<h3>Policy Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Access Tiers:</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Members:</em> Standard library cardholders pay a nominal fee (e.g., $0.20/copy, $0.50/scan).</li>
<li><em>Visitors:</em> Non-cardholders access machines with coin or tap-to-pay options.</li>
<li><em>Hardship:</em> Free emergency copies/scans for job-seekers or urgent cases (e.g., applications due same day), verified by staff discretion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Manager Override:</strong> Authorize frontline staff to approve one-off free services in urgent cases (decision logged, 10-second process).</li>
<li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Install pay-per-use kiosks in libraries, community centers, and agencies like WINZ. Ensure at least one functional machine per site.</li>
<li><strong>Outcome Log:</strong> Track usage (copies/scans issued, hardship cases) and link to outcomes (e.g., job applications submitted, interviews secured).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Roll out kiosks in 10 key locations within 12 months.</li>
<li>Train staff on override protocols and log system.</li>
<li>Budget for kiosk maintenance and voucher program ($50,000/year).</li>
<li>Report annually on usage and employment outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="responsive-governance">
<h2>3. Responsive Governance <span class="badge">Service Standard</span></h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Ensure council candidates and staff respond to public queries promptly and substantively, eliminating “didn’t hear the question” excuses.</p>

<h3>Policy Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response Standard:</strong> All public queries (rates, services, policy) receive a substantive reply within 48 hours. Responses must address the question, offer solutions, or explain why not with alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>Written Clarity:</strong> Hardship policies (e.g., rates postponement) summarized in one-page, plain-English documents. Maximum two pages, like a pavlova recipe.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Candidates or officials who fail to respond or dodge questions must issue a public correction and answer in writing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update council service standards within 3 months.</li>
<li>Train staff on response protocols; include in performance reviews.</li>
<li>Monitor compliance via public feedback portal.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="dashboards">
<h2>4. Public Dashboards for Transparency <span class="badge">Open Data</span></h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Build trust by publishing clear, regular data on hardship relief, service access, and policy outcomes.</p>

<h3>Policy Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metrics Tracked:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rates postponements: applications, approvals, total deferred, arrears reduced.</li>
<li>Document services: copies/scans issued, hardship vouchers used, linked job outcomes.</li>
<li>Council responsiveness: query volume, response times, resolution rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Quarterly reports published on council website, accessible in plain English and visualized (e.g., charts).</li>
<li><strong>Access:</strong> Free to view, no login required. Hard copies available at libraries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<h2>5. Mercy in Governance <span class="badge">Compassion</span></h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Embed compassion as a core principle, ensuring policies bend toward human good without sacrificing accountability.</p>

<h3>Policy Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discretion Protocol:</strong> Authorize frontline staff (e.g., library, WINZ, council) to make humane exceptions in urgent cases (e.g., free copies, rates relief), logged for audit.</li>
<li><strong>Hardship Fund:</strong> Small annual fund ($100,000) for one-off relief (e.g., emergency rates grants, document vouchers) for residents outside existing criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Training:</strong> Mandatory compassion-focused training for staff, emphasizing “mercy seasons justice” in decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Establish fund and protocol within 9 months.</li>
<li>Train 80% of frontline staff within 12 months.</li>
<li>Report fund usage in quarterly dashboards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Open Election Stage <span class="badge">Fair Play</span></h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Ensure fair, transparent candidate selection and public engagement in council elections, rejecting opaque processes like the leaked memo mandating staff votes.</p>

<h3>Policy Components</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Candidate Access:</strong> All candidates (e.g., 12, not just 4) get equal stage time at public forums. If limited, livestream all candidate statements for public access.</li>
<li><strong>Staff Voting:</strong> Prohibit mandates (e.g., 1400 staff forced to vote for 14 of 51 councillors). Voting is voluntary, anonymous, and free from coercion.</li>
<li><strong>Public Audit:</strong> Independent review of election processes, including candidate selection and staff voting policies, published 30 days before election.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Amend election bylaws within 12 months.</li>
<li>Contract independent auditor ($50,000 budget).</li>
<li>Livestream setup for forums ($10,000/year).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Closing Pledge</h2>
<div class="callout">
