      <h1>Hamilton,</h1>
      <p class="lede">
        We are just <strong>hours</strong> away from making one of the most important choices our city will see this term.
        As candidate for <strong>Deputy Mayor</strong>, I want to talk to you about what I believe a good Mayor for Hamilton must bring — and why
        <strong>Roderick J. Young</strong> fits that vision.
      </p>

      <ol class="points">
        <li>
          <strong>Transparency, accountability, and deep local focus.</strong>
          Roderick commits to publishing clear dashboards of rates, debt, contracts, and decisions.
          He doesn’t promise speeches; he promises to post every vote and reason within 48 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fairness in the cost of living.</strong>
          Roderick’s pledge to review the rates system — especially in suburbs like Dinsdale, Nawton, and the Westside —
          shows he’s focused on fairness, not burdening long-time residents.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Safer streets and effective transport.</strong>
          Roderick’s proposals include footpath upgrades, traffic calming near schools, and making buses truly work for all suburbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Courage in financial leadership.</strong>
          A Mayor who can stop money leaking offshore and reinvest it locally. Roderick’s bold Hamilton Civic Bank vision
          redirects mortgage interest back into our community to pay down debt and lower rates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Growth that respects communities.</strong>
          Housing done <em>with</em> us, not <em>to</em> us: neighbourhood design panels, balanced infill, protection of green space, and meaningful consultation.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="cta" role="note" aria-label="Call to action">
        <p>
          In these final hours, I ask you: vote not just for a name, but for the kind of leadership Hamilton deserves.
          A Mayor who <strong>listens, acts, and shares power</strong>.
          I believe that’s what Roderick brings — and as your Deputy Mayor partner, I will work every day to make sure we deliver.
        </p>
        <p class="signature">
          Let’s make these last <strong>hous</strong> count. Rank your vote wisely. <strong>Thank you, Hamilton!</strong>
