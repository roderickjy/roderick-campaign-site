    <section id="beginnings">
      <h2>Beginnings</h2>
      <p>
        Life begins at birth, marked by first experiences such as entering school, completing middle school,
        and eventually graduating high school. Along the way come milestones like the first romance, first car,
        and first paying job.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="young-adulthood">
      <h2>Young Adulthood</h2>
      <p>
        From there, young adulthood unfolds with choices that shape the future: choosing a major, going to college,
        finishing schooling, and possibly graduate school. Careers begin, passions deepen, and the search for serious
        romance and long-term partnerships begins.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="maturity">
      <h2>Maturity</h2>
      <p>
        As life progresses into maturity, one may marry, raise children, and juggle career responsibilities.
        This stage often involves buying a first home, seeking financial security, and striving toward big goals.
        It’s the era of balancing personal ambition with the needs of family, while also facing challenges like
        health concerns or managing setbacks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mid-life">
      <h2>Mid-Life Transitions</h2>
      <p>
        The mid-life phase introduces major transitions: children grow up, go to college, and eventually leave home.
        Careers peak or evolve, and financial independence is either secured or re-evaluated. Relationships mature,
        sometimes tested by divorce or the loss of parents.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="later-life">
      <h2>Later Life</h2>
      <p>
        Later life brings a shift in focus. Grandchildren may arrive, and time is increasingly devoted to family,
        friends, travel, and hobbies. Helping others succeed becomes a priority, alongside the hope that dreams and
        values continue even after one’s direct involvement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="closing-arc">
      <h2>Closing the Arc</h2>
      <p>
        As age advances, life’s arc includes inevitable losses: friends and spouses may pass away, illnesses or
        accidents may emerge, and the effort to fight for health and longevity intensifies. Finally, the arc closes
        with passing away—ideally after a full life, where contributions and legacies endure beyond one’s lifetime.
