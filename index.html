  <h2>What It Means for You in Hamilton West</h2>
  <p><em>Making politics personal, practical, and local</em></p>

  <article>
    <h3>🏡 Fairer Rates for Westside Households</h3>
    <p><strong>You’ve been paying too much — and getting too little.</strong></p>
    <p>In Hamilton West, many homes have seen rising rates while basic services stay the same or even decline.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A full review of the rates system to ensure <strong>fairness by suburb</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop punishing long-time residents</strong> with sharp increases.</li>
      <li>Keep rates <strong>predictable and transparent</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📍 Example:</strong> In places like Nawton and Dinsdale, many families and pensioners are facing sharp rate hikes — this must stop.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>🛣️ Safer Streets, Better Roads, Proper Footpaths</h3>
    <p><strong>You walk, bike, drive, or catch the bus — and you’ve seen the cracks.</strong></p>
    <p>Older suburbs in Hamilton West have been neglected — with poor lighting, broken footpaths, and risky crossings.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ward-by-ward audit of <strong>urgent safety upgrades</strong>.</li>
      <li>Traffic-calming near schools and shops.</li>
      <li>Clear timelines and public updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📍 Example:</strong> Ellicott Road and parts of Nawton Road need speed control and footpath renewal.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>🚍 Public Transport that Actually Serves You</h3>
    <p><strong>You’d use the bus or train — if it worked for you.</strong></p>
    <p>Public transport is slow, patchy, and doesn’t connect Hamilton West well.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Push for <strong>15-minute frequency</strong> on key bus routes.</li>
      <li>Improve <strong>bus stop safety and shelters</strong>.</li>
      <li>Start transport planning from the suburbs out — not the CBD in.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📍 Example:</strong> In Western Heights and Nawton, buses are slow and indirect — we can fix this.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>🏦 The Hamilton Bank – Keep the Money Here</h3>
    <p><strong>Your rates and loans shouldn’t line corporate pockets.</strong></p>
    <p>Big banks profit while Hamilton borrows billions — and we all pay for it.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish a <strong>Hamilton Civic Bank</strong> to:
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce borrowing costs.</li>
          <li>Invest in local infrastructure.</li>
          <li>Offer ethical, transparent lending.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📍 What it means for you:</strong> More value from your rates, support for home buyers and small businesses in Hamilton West.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>🌳 Protecting West’s Green Spaces & Parks</h3>
    <p><strong>Your suburb deserves beauty and breathing space.</strong></p>
    <p>Hamilton West has parks that are loved but under-resourced.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lock in <strong>protections for parks and reserves</strong>.</li>
      <li>Restore <strong>playgrounds, sports fields, and toilets</strong>.</li>
      <li>Create more <strong>pocket parks and gardens</strong> in new developments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📍 Example:</strong> Elliott Park and Swarbrick Park need upgrades and proper care.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>🧱 Infill Housing Done <em>With</em> You, Not <em>To</em> You</h3>
    <p><strong>Yes to smart growth. No to characterless cramming.</strong></p>
    <p>We need housing, but Westside neighbourhoods shouldn’t be overwhelmed without say.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neighbourhood design panels</strong> to shape new builds.</li>
      <li>Ensure <strong>green space, parking, and drainage</strong> in all infill housing.</li>
      <li>Focus on <strong>affordable home ownership</strong>, not just rentals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>📍 What it means for you:</strong> Protect your street’s character, safety, and value.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>🤝 Real Representation, Not Hollow Promises</h3>
    <p><strong>I’m not here to join a party line — I’m here to represent <em>you</em>.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Monthly drop-ins across Hamilton West.</li>
      <li>Full transparency on <strong>votes and policies</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Independent voice</strong> — no party pressure, just your concerns.</li>
    </ul>
  </article>

      <h1>Mayoral Candidates Face Off at Victoria on the River Forum</h1>
      <p><strong>Hamilton, NZ — Monday, 5–7 PM</strong></p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>
        In a spirited evening of civic engagement, Victoria on the River played host to a lively candidates’ meeting 
        featuring three mayoral hopefuls and representation from each of Hamilton’s wards — 
        <strong>West</strong>, <strong>East</strong>, and <strong>Māori</strong>. The open-air forum brought local politics 
        directly to the people, blending formal presentations with the rhythms of city life, as passersby on foot, wheels, 
        and bikes added to the dynamic audience.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        Each mayoral candidate presented a unique resolution they would bring to the first official council meeting. 
        Proposals ranged from <em>removing unpopular road humps</em> to introducing a <em>two-term limit</em> for elected 
        officials. The diversity of ideas reflected a shared desire for fresh thinking and stronger accountability 
        within the council.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        Notable speakers included <strong>Roma Warren</strong> and <strong>Lawrence</strong>, who delivered clear, impassioned 
        remarks on their visions for Hamilton’s future. Also drawing applause was the incumbent councillor who proudly noted 
        a <strong>100% attendance record</strong> throughout the current term — a point of pride and commitment that resonated 
        with attendees.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        Several candidates highlighted their attendance at recent <strong>Chamber of Commerce</strong> events, underlining 
        their engagement with both business and community concerns.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        The crowd ebbed and flowed throughout the evening — a unique mix of RSVP attendees and curious passersby. Despite 
        challenges in reaching all candidates due to incomplete contact information, the organizers were pleased to report 
        that <strong>over 50%</strong> had responded to the invitation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, organizers are planning to continue these sessions weekly, every <strong>Monday from 5–7 PM</strong>, 
        leading up to the election. Next week’s focus will shift to <strong><em>mana wāhine</em></strong>, following this week’s 
        opening theme of <strong><em>mana tāne</em></strong>. <strong>Maria</strong> — both Marias — have been warmly welcomed 
        to join the next session.

  <p>
    Roderick J. Young is a hands‑on community advocate focused on fair rates, safer streets, and growth that pays its way. 
    He brings practical budgeting and a do‑the‑work ethic—getting small things fixed so the big things add up.
  </p>

  <h3>Bio (120 words)</h3>
  <p>
    Roderick has deep roots in Hamilton West—from Frankton to Dinsdale and Nawton. He’s worked alongside clubs, small 
    businesses, and neighbours to solve everyday problems: safety hotspots, maintenance backlogs, and confusing council 
    processes. His focus is simple: keep rates fair, publish clear numbers, and make growth pay its way so existing 
    ratepayers aren’t left carrying the can. He’ll front up monthly with neighbourhood surgeries and post every vote 
    and reason within 48 hours.

  <h1>Policy Priorities – Council Platform</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Rates &amp; debt</strong> – Freeze nice-to-have growth, sequence capital projects, and publish a plain-English debt &amp; rates dashboard.
      <span class="proof">Proof: monthly variance to budget, public.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rates-hardship</strong> – Offer postponement on title for cash-poor/house-rich; cap interest to a transparent formula.
      <span class="proof">Proof: uptake + arrears trend.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Transparency</strong> – Default-open data on contracts, change orders, and KPIs.
      <span class="proof">Proof: on-time, on-budget scorecards per project.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Procurement (buy local)</strong> – Weighted scoring for local suppliers where lawful; split tenders so SMEs can bid.
      <span class="proof">Proof: % spend with local firms.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consents speed</strong> – Triage simple consents, publish median days, and ‘fix-it-with-me’ desks.
      <span class="proof">Proof: 90-day backlog cleared by X date.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Affordable subdivisions</strong> – Pre-zone + pre-service where pipes/roads exist; require affordable lots in staged releases.
      <span class="proof">Proof: lots consented, average section price.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>LIM access</strong> – Accessible, low-cost LIMs with auto-released standard data.
      <span class="proof">Proof: price drop + turnaround time.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Three Waters / water services</strong> – Prioritise leak reduction, stormwater hotspots, and treatment resilience.
      <span class="proof">Proof: leaks per km, boil-notice days = 0.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Roading &amp; safety</strong> – Fix high-harm intersections first; maintain before new monuments.
      <span class="proof">Proof: KSI reduction year-on-year.</span>

    </li>
    <li>

      <span class="proof">Proof: counts on completed links.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Parking</strong> – Dynamic pricing in the CBD; resident permits near hotspots.
      <span class="proof">Proof: occupancy 70–85% target.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Community safety</strong> – Light the dark spots, activate spaces, fund proven youth pathways with NGOs.
      <span class="proof">Proof: reported incidents drop at treated sites.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Parks &amp; libraries</strong> – Protect maintenance budgets; libraries as warm, learning hubs.
      <span class="proof">Proof: footfall + program participation.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Events &amp; economy</strong> – Prioritise events that fill beds and tills.
      <span class="proof">Proof: independent econ impact per $ of council support.</span>
    </li>

      <strong>Climate &amp; resilience</strong> – Flood maps into planning rules; lift floor levels in risk areas.
      <span class="proof">Proof: insured losses avoided after next storm.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Waste &amp; recycling</strong> – Cut contamination with ‘oops tags’; expand organics where cost-effective.
      <span class="proof">Proof: contamination % and landfill tonnage.</span>
    </li>

      <span class="proof">Proof: resolution times.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Heritage &amp; culture</strong> – Support adaptive reuse; small grants where a little saves a lot.
      <span class="proof">Proof: heritage places reused not demolished.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Youth engagement</strong> – Youth panel tied to budget priorities; fund spaces they design.
      <span class="proof">Proof: attendance + retention.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Māori partnership</strong> – Co-design on land/water and place names; measure outcomes not meetings.
      <span class="proof">Proof: agreed indicators reported jointly.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Small business</strong> – One-stop startup desk: signage/consent/food regs.
      <span class="proof">Proof: time to first sale.</span>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Digital services</strong> – Track requests from app to fix; publish queue.
      <span class="proof">Proof: median resolution time down.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Procurement integrity</strong> – Publish shortlist, scoring, and change orders.
      <span class="proof">Proof: fewer disputes, lower overruns.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Big builds (value)</strong> – Stage gates with stop/go triggers; kill low-value scope creep.
      <span class="proof">Proof: benefit–cost ratio preserved at each gate.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rates fairness</strong> – Keep essentials first; nice-to-haves last.
      <span class="proof">Proof: share of spend on core services ≥ target.</span>

  <ul>
    <li>CHORUS OF KIRIKIRIROA – the river’s voice, your friendly explainer.</li>
    <li>BILLY THE JESTER – MC with a wink; keeps it plain.</li>
    <li>THE RETURNING OFFICER – pilot of quotas and transfers.</li>
    <li>LADY SPREADSHEET – tidy budgets, tidy ballots.</li>

    <li>THE PURSE – a literal moneybag; unexpectedly thoughtful.</li>
    <li>THE PEOPLE – the voters (that’s you).</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Prologue</h2>
  <p><span class="character">CHORUS:</span><br>
  Good folk of Hamilton, hear the secret gears—<br>
  This city uses STV: you rank your choices 1, 2, 3… in order you truly prefer. It’s postal voting: a pack arrives; you number the boxes; you post it back. Easy as.</p>

  <p><span class="character">BILLY THE JESTER (to audience):</span><br>
  Translation: write numbers, not ticks; your “1” is your fave, your “2” is your back-up, then keep going with anyone you’d actually be okay with. That’s the whole game, e hoa.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Act I – The Kitchen Table (How to Mark the Paper)</h2>
  <p class="stage-direction">(A ballot appears like a placemat. The PURSE sits politely to one side.)</p>

  <p><span class="character">NANA RATEPAYER (reading):</span><br>
  So I number the good ones. Must I number everyone?</p>

  <p><span class="character">RETURNING OFFICER:</span><br>
  Nay, only those you support. But the more you rank (honestly), the more power your vote has if it needs to move. Don’t give two people the same number. Don’t use ticks like FPP. If you put two “1”s, your ballot’s “1” is invalid. Keep it clean: 1, 2, 3…</p>

  <p class="refrain"><span class="character">CHORUS (refrain):</span><br>
  Rank your heart #1, your head #2, your “still fine” #3 and more—<br>
  Later numbers never harm the ones before.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Act II – The Counting Hall (First Preferences)</h2>
  <p class="stage-direction">(Lecterns, lamps, and little buckets labelled with candidate names. Marbles = votes.)</p>

  <p><span class="character">RETURNING OFFICER (placing marbles):</span><br>
  Step the First: We count every “1”. These are first preferences.<br>
  Step the Second: We set a target (quota) so only as many candidates as there are seats can be elected—hit the target, you’re in. (The maths is done by computer because transfers are fractional; you don’t have to do any sums—just rank.)</p>

  <p><span class="character">BILLY THE JESTER:</span><br>
  If your #1 smashes the target with extra votes, a fair slice of each of those ballots flows onward to the voters’ #2—so your vote helps your fave and your next fave. If your #1 flops, your full vote slides to your #2. Either way, ranking keeps your vote alive.</p>

  <p class="refrain"><span class="character">CHORUS (refrain):</span><br>
  Rank long, rank true—<br>
  If #1 can’t win or has more than they need, your vote keeps working for you.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Act III – Surpluses & Eliminations (Why Transfers Matter)</h2>
  <p class="stage-direction">(Buckets burble like little streams; marbles trickle along clear tubes.)</p>

  <p><span class="character">LADY SPREADSHEET (pointing to a bucket that overfloweth):</span><br>
  Behold a surplus! Candidate met the target with more than needed.<br>
  We transfer just enough of each ballot (fractionally) so they keep the target and the rest flows to the next ranked still-in-the-race. The algorithm is careful and consistent. You just had to number your paper.</p>

  <p><span class="character">SIR DOOR KNOCK (patting an empty bucket):</span><br>
  And the lowest-placed? Eliminated. Their ballots transfer at full value to each voter’s next ranked still-standing. If a ballot has no further ranks, it can’t move and stops—another reason to keep ranking people you can live with.</p>

  <p class="refrain"><span class="character">CHORUS (refrain):</span><br>
  Second choices save the day;<br>
  Third choices pave the way.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Act IV – The Cast Learn by Doing</h2>

  <p><span class="character">DAME TIKTOK:</span><br>
  So my fans rank me #1, but if I’ve got heaps extra, a slice of their vote powers their #2? That’s… community-minded. I like it.</p>

  <p><span class="character">LORD HOARDING:</span> (counting his chin on a billboard)<br>
  And if I’m last—</p>

  <p><span class="character">BILLY THE JESTER:</span><br>
  —your supporters aren’t stranded. Their ballots march to their #2. That’s why being a decent #2 or #3 to lots of folks can beat being a polarising #1. Rank widely, whānau!</p>

  <p><span class="character">COUNT CORFLUTE (holding two “1”s):</span><br>
  What if they mark two “1”s because they love me and… also me?</p>

  <p><span class="character">RETURNING OFFICER:</span><br>
  Then their “1” is invalid. Don’t do that. One “1”. Then “2”, then “3” in order. No duplicate numbers, no ticks. Numbers only.</p>

  <p><span class="character">THE STUDENT:</span><br>
  And Hamilton really is STV this year?</p>

  <p><span class="character">CHORUS:</span><br>
  Aye. The Council chose STV (kept for 2022 & 2025), and the 2025 election uses it. Rank and return that postal pack.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Act V – The Ripple to the Finish (Rounds Keep Cycling)</h2>

  <p><span class="character">RETURNING OFFICER (ringing a bell):</span><br>
  Count proceeds in rounds:</p>
  <h2>How we get there:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Visitors cover the interest</strong> through accommodation rates and local spending.</li>
    <li><strong>Locals with library cards</strong> help contribute to repaying the capital.</li>
    <li>Currently, <span class="highlight">70% of Hamilton’s 64,000 rateable properties</span> are sending mortgage and loan interest to offshore banks.</li>
    <li>That’s <span class="highlight">$500 million a year</span> in profit leaving our local economy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>By creating a <strong>Hamilton-owned community bank</strong>, we can stop that financial drain and invest those funds directly back into the city — into housing, infrastructure, services, and a better future for everyone.</p>

  <p><strong>Hamilton can lead New Zealand</strong> by becoming the first city to reclaim local wealth for local benefit.</p>

    <h2>🧾 Seven Chiefs of Kirikiriroa: In Order</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anthony Briscoe</strong> (~1999–2004) – Pre-stadium, managed steady urban expansion.</li>
      <li><strong>Michael Redman</strong> (2004–2010) – Visionary but fiscally loose; stadium and V8s.</li>
      <li><strong>Barry Harris</strong> (2010–2014) – Stabiliser; cleaned up but lacked vision.</li>
      <li><strong>David Ayers</strong> (Acting, 2014) – Brief tenure, maintained status quo.</li>
      <li><strong>Richard Briggs</strong> (2014–2020) – Architect of modern Hamilton’s infrastructure; doubled debt.</li>
      <li><strong>Jan Gascoigne</strong> (Acting, 2020) – Steward through storm, no big plays.</li>
      <li><strong>Lance Vervoort</strong> (2020– ) – Accountable leader; inherits burden, seeks balance.</li>

    <h2>🎭 Addendum: A New Chorus for the Seven</h2>
    <pre>
Chorus (returning in jandals, clipboard in hand):

Seven Chiefs have shaped this tale,
From Briscoe's calm to Redman's gale.
Harris steadied, Ayers held ground,
Then Briggs with billions did abound.
Gascoigne bridged, and Lance now bears
The cones, the wrath, the public stares.

Each choice a ripple, each plan a cost—
A billion and more, in dreams embossed.
Yet in gumboots we still trudge the way,
Asking, “When's that pothole fixed, eh?”

  <h2 id="debt-overview">Who Hamilton City Council Owes ($1.3&nbsp;billion)</h2>
  <p>Hamilton City Council’s <strong>$1.3&nbsp;billion</strong> debt isn’t owed to just one lender — it’s spread across a few main sources:</p>

  <hr>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>New Zealand Local Government Funding Agency (<abbr title="Local Government Funding Agency">LGFA</abbr>)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The LGFA is the biggest single lender to NZ councils.</li>
        <li>It’s a council-owned cooperative debt agency that borrows cheaply on the international and NZ bond markets, then on-lends to councils.</li>
        <li>Hamilton, like most big councils, does most of its borrowing through the LGFA.</li>
        <li>In return, councils guarantee each other’s debt, so Hamilton is jointly liable with other councils if one fails.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <hr>

    <li>
      <h3>Direct Bank Loans</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Historically, councils also borrowed from commercial banks (ANZ, BNZ, Westpac, ASB).</li>
        <li>This is a smaller proportion today, since LGFA generally offers lower interest rates and longer terms.</li>
        <li>Some short-term facilities may still be with banks to manage cash flow.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <hr>

    <li>
      <h3>Bond Market Investors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>LGFA issues bonds (essentially IOUs) to large institutional investors, such as:</li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>NZ Super Fund</li>
            <li>KiwiSaver funds</li>
            <li>Insurance companies</li>
            <li>Offshore pension/sovereign funds</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>These investors ultimately hold the paper that Hamilton is paying interest on.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <hr>

    <li>
      <h3>Crown Infrastructure Partners (specific projects)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>For certain big capital projects (like Peacocke housing development, or parts of Three Waters upgrades), the Crown provides infrastructure funding agreements.</li>
        <li>This usually means government loans or targeted grants with strings attached (debt still sits on the council’s books, but repayments may be structured over decades).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h3>✅ So in plain terms</h3>
  <p>Hamilton City Council’s <strong>$1.3b</strong> is owed mainly to the <strong>LGFA</strong> (by far the biggest share), with some exposure to <strong>banks</strong>, and ultimately backed by <strong>bondholders and institutional investors</strong> who buy LGFA securities.</p>
</section>

<h2>Interest on Council Debt & User-Pays Relief</h2>

<p>We assume total debt of <strong>$1.3&nbsp;billion</strong>, 64,000 ratable properties,

<h3>User-Pays: Non-Resident Library Memberships</h3>
<p>Residents and ratepayers keep free library cards. Visitors/non-residents pay a fair fee. Every dollar raised can be applied to reduce the interest burden, lowering rates for everyone.</p>

<p><em>Rule of thumb (with 64,000 properties):</em>
<br>• Every <strong>$64,000</strong> of revenue reduces the average bill by <strong>$1</strong> per property.
<br>• <strong>$3.2m</strong> lowers the average bill by <strong>$50</strong>.
<br>• <strong>$6.4m</strong> lowers the average bill by <strong>$100</strong>.
<br>• At a 6% interest case, <strong>$7.8m</strong> offsets <strong>10%</strong> of the annual interest.</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> keeping libraries free for locals while charging visitors a modest fee
can directly reduce the interest share of rates. Scale the fee or the number of non-resident memberships
to target specific savings (e.g., $50 or $100 off the average bill).</p>

  <h1>🏦 Hamilton Bank Proposal</h1>
  <p><strong>A Community-Owned Solution to Hamilton’s $1.3 Billion Debt</strong></p>

  <hr>

  <section>
    <h2>⸻ Assumptions:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>60% of properties have a mortgage → 38,400 mortgaged homes</li>
      <li>$550k average mortgage (per mortgaged home)</li>
      <li>6.5% average mortgage rate</li>
      <li>For offshore flow proxy:
        <ul>
          <li>2% NIM (bank profit on loans)</li>
          <li>85% of profits remitted offshore</li>
          <li>30% wholesale funding from offshore at 5%</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Annual mortgage interest paid (gross): ≈ $1.37 billion</li>
      <li>Per mortgaged home: ≈ $35,800/year interest</li>
      <li>Averaged across all 64k properties: ≈ $21,400/year (illustrative burden per property)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Estimated offshore outflow:</strong> ≈ $511 million per year</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a proxy for money likely leaving NZ via dividends to Australian parents plus interest to offshore wholesale funders.</li>
      <li>It’s not the whole interest bill (a chunk of interest pays local depositors, staff, taxes, etc.), but it’s a reasonable estimate of net leakage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why show both?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gross interest</strong> = what households actually pay.</li>
      <li><strong>Estimated offshore outflow</strong> = the portion plausibly leaving the local/national economy.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      “Hamilton households are paying ~$1.4 billion a year in mortgage interest at today’s settings.”<br>
      “We estimate ~$500 million a year leaks offshore through dividends and wholesale funding. A locally owned bank keeps more of that money here.”<br>
      “Every 1 percentage point change in average mortgage rate shifts total interest by ~$210 million in this mid case.”

    <h2>🎯 Core Purpose</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a locally owned public/community bank, seeded by Hamilton City Council, iwi partners, and residents.</li>
      <li>Channel the $500m+ of annual mortgage interest currently leaking offshore back into Hamilton.</li>
      <li>Dedicate bank profits to repaying council debt, lowering rates, and funding infrastructure.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🔑 How It Works</h2>

    <h3>1. Capital & Ownership</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Council equity (e.g., transferring existing cash reserves)</li>
      <li>Local iwi investment (Treaty partnership)</li>
      <li>Citizen share issue (Hamilton residents can buy small stakes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Banking Focus</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mortgages for Hamilton residents</li>
      <li>Loans to local businesses and community housing projects</li>
      <li>Everyday banking: deposits, savings, EFTPOS, online services</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Debt Repayment Mechanism</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All profits (after operating costs and prudent reserves) dedicated to:
        <ol>
          <li>Paying down council debt</li>
          <li>Reducing future ratepayer interest burden</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Example:
        <ul>
          <li>If Hamilton Bank captured 25% of Hamilton mortgages (~$9b loan book)</li>
          <li>At a 2% net margin, it earns $180m profit/year</li>
          <li>Even after prudential reserves, $100m+/year could be directed to council debt — clearing the $1.3b in under 15 years</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Community Return</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Free library cards & essential services for residents</li>
      <li>Lower fees for locals vs. big four banks</li>
      <li>Priority lending to local housing projects</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>⚖️ Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep profits local: No more $500m/year leaking to Australia</li>
      <li>Faster debt repayment: Direct pipeline to retire council’s $1.3b debt</li>
      <li>Fair rates: Every $100m of debt repaid cuts ~$20m/year in interest, lowering rates pressure</li>
      <li>Partnership with iwi: Aligns with Treaty obligations and co-governance principles</li>
      <li>Stronger resilience: Local deposits funding local lending, insulated from global shocks</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>🚩 Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Must meet Reserve Bank licensing & capital adequacy rules</li>
      <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Needs enough mortgages to make an impact (at least $5–10b loan book)</li>
      <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Council exposed if governance fails — requires strong professional management</li>
      <li><strong>Politics:</strong> Will face pushback from Australian-owned banks, central government, and some ratepayers wary of council in finance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📣 Campaign Slogan</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “Hamilton’s Money for Hamilton’s Future”
    </blockquote>
    <p>Instead of sending half a billion dollars in mortgage interest offshore every year, let’s build a bank that pays down our city’s debt, lowers rates, and invests in our people.</p>

      Place: A modest flat in Hamilton. Mesh sits at a glowing computer, lit only by the blue hue of inspiration.

      Awake again at yon ungodly hour—<br>
      Three bells and half! Oh, cursed sleepless power!<br>
      To rouse me thus with click and screen aglow,<br>
      To pen a play the council shan’t bestow.<br><br>

      I read again: "So, so good!" they cry.<br>
      Aye, lyrics born to make the angels sigh!<br>
      Yet when I sought a notice, clean and proud,<br>
      They struck me down, denied me to the crowd.<br><br>

      Monday the Eighth! Victoria on the stream!<br>
      Shall I be silenced in democracy's dream?<br>
      If I—a candidate—be cast aside,<br>
      Then woe to them whose conscience doth divide!

      So onward must we trudge through civic fog,<br>
      With pens for swords and minds unclogged.<br>
      Let ballots speak and silence fade—<br>
      For Hamilton's future must be made.<br><br>

      Also—<br>
      “So, so good!” could be a tune,<br>
      I’ll write it down... maybe real soon.
