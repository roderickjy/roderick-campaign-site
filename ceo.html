  <h1>Ten Draft Resolutions for CEO Implementation</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Fiscal Guardrail and Transparency Dashboard</strong><br>
      That the CEO establish a public-facing “Hamilton Fiscal Dashboard” reporting quarterly on debt levels, rates trajectory, capital projects, and overruns, with data simplified for public understanding.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Expenditure Review and 10% Efficiency Programme</strong><br>
      That the CEO conduct a line-by-line operating expenditure review, identifying options for up to 10% efficiency savings across Council operations without reduction in essential service standards, and report within six months.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Procurement and Contracting Transparency</strong><br>
      That the CEO publish all procurement opportunities and awarded contracts in an open-tender portal, updated in real time, with mandatory post-project reviews of scope, cost, and outcomes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Project Gating and Stop/Go Framework</strong><br>
      That the CEO institute a mandatory “business case and checkpoint” process for all capital projects over $2 million, with clear stop/go gates at design, procurement, and delivery stages.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consent Processing Acceleration</strong><br>
      That the CEO establish a fast-track pathway for low-risk building and resource consents, with a 30-day maximum processing KPI, and publish monthly performance metrics.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Growth and Rate-Base Expansion</strong><br>
      That the CEO prepare a “brownfields and infill” housing strategy, including policy to support secondary dwellings (“granny flats”) and affordable subdivision pilots, to grow the ratepayer base.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Water Loss Reduction and Resilience</strong><br>
      That the CEO implement a leak-detection and repair programme targeting a 20% reduction in system losses within three years, and pilot rainwater harvesting partnerships to defer costly metering decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prioritisation of Core Services</strong><br>
      That the CEO report annually on service-level compliance for roads, footpaths, lighting, stormwater, and safety assets, with these designated as Tier 1 priorities for maintenance funding.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Visitor and User-Pays Revenue Pilot</strong><br>
      That the CEO develop proposals for new visitor-pays models (including differential parking, zoo/public facility fees, and event levies) with impact assessments, for Council consideration before the 2026 LTP.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Staff Engagement and Innovation Drive</strong><br>
      That the CEO establish a “1400 Ideas for Hamilton” staff innovation challenge, inviting all staff to contribute cost-saving or revenue-generating ideas, with annual reporting on uptake and outcomes.
    </li>
  </ol>
