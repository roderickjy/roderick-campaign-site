<h2>Hamilton’s Debt & Who We Owe</h2>
<p>Hamilton City debt is ~NZ$1.2–1.3B. Major channels include the LGFA (on-lending from bond markets), some direct bank facilities, and institutional investors who ultimately hold the paper.

<section id="rebuilding-accountability" style="max-width: 720px; margin: 2rem auto; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; color: #111;">
  <h2>Rebuilding Council Accountability: No to Lazy Politics, Yes to Structural Change</h2>
  <p><strong>Roderick J. Young — Candidate for Hamilton City Council (General Ward)</strong></p>

  <p>At the Glenview Community Centre meeting, I spoke directly against Tim’s proposal for rate caps mandated by central government. Leo also raised a valid point: rate capping is lazy politics. It gives a short-term soundbite but does nothing to fix the underlying issues in council spending and decision-making. As Maxine rightly noted, it’s <em>"lazy politics for lazy politicians."</em></p>

  <p>Hamilton’s real issue is not income—it’s management. As Colin Jones pointed out, Hamilton City Council (HCC) is <strong>technically insolvent</strong>, masked only by its ability to keep raising rates. Without that power, we’d be in the same boat as several UK and US cities that have defaulted on their debts.</p>

  <p>Colin is right: HCC has been papering over financial cracks for years. Developers are shown theoretical spreadsheets of "Development Contributions" (DCs), but the actual income is over $250 million short. Councillors are being fed rubbish information, left confused, and ultimately sidelined. The Audit Office? Asleep at the wheel for a decade.</p>

  <h3>From Staff-Led to Member-Led Governance</h3>

  <p>Mesh and I, over a simple cup of tea, discussed a structural fix:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Appoint three elected members to sit in on decisions between the CEO and senior department heads.
  </blockquote>

  <p>This committee would require <strong>two out of three sign-offs</strong> from elected representatives for decisions to proceed—especially anything involving public money or strategic direction. It’s a real-time audit of executive power, not a post-mortem.</p>

  <p>Let’s be honest: right now, staff can—and do—wait out councillors. Over the term of seven CEOs, we’ve seen a city budget balloon from <strong>$180 million to $1.22 billion</strong>. If council doesn’t assert control, nothing changes.</p>

  <p>This committee idea is how a new council gains back control. Not by trimming fat alone, but by restoring democratic oversight at the point of decision-making. I challenge the 12 mayoral candidates to say whether they support this reform. <strong>I’m happy to serve as the deputy mayor</strong> who helps make it real.</p>

  <h3>Rates, Productivity, and the Real Fix</h3>

  <p>While Rudi’s proposed 10% cuts across departments is one way to wake up the bureaucracy, my focus is on a <strong>34% city-wide increase in productivity</strong>—among council staff, businesses, and households alike.</p>

  <p>As the Binn Inn owner in Dinsdale told me:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “If my turnover increased by 34%, I could absorb rates going from $10,000 to $20,000. My fixed costs stay the same—turnover is everything.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is the kind of conversation we should be having: not short-term cuts or hollow caps, but economic uplift, efficiency, and better public service.</p>

  <h3>The Next 23 Days Matter</h3>

  <p>We have just <strong>23 days</strong> until polls close at <strong>12 noon on 11 October 2025</strong>. This election matters. It’s not just about the mayor—it’s about who you elect to the council table. We need strong, independent, and skilled voices willing to speak up <em>now</em>, not after the results are in.</p>

  <p>I invite the public and fellow candidates to attend the next public meetings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>5–7PM, Mondays: 22 & 29 September; 6, 13, and 20 October</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Victoria on the River, CBD</li>
    <li><strong>Details:</strong> <a href="https://roderickjy.github.io/roderick-campaign-site/kirk.html" target="_blank">Event page</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We cannot afford another three years of drift, confusion, and staff-led governance. It’s time for clear thinking, honest conversation, and democratic reform.</p>

  Candidate for Hamilton City Council (General Ward)</p>

  <h3>Infrastructure and the New CCO: Concerns Raised</h3>
  <p><strong>From: Colin Jones, AREINZ<br>
  Director</strong></p>

  <p><em>Good morning all,</em></p>

  <p>I have reviewed most of the documentation for the new Council-Controlled Organisation (CCO). It is proposed to use the same <strong>“flawed” methodology</strong> for infrastructure planning that has caused many of HCC’s current problems.</p>

  <p>The only difference is that the <strong>debt will be 500% of income</strong>, compared to the 280% ratio HCC is currently using. There will also be a <strong>“separate line” in the rates bill</strong> specifically for infrastructure.</p>

  <p>The infrastructure deficit has increased dramatically, from <strong>$12.5 billion in 2021</strong> to approximately <strong>$28.5 billion in 2025</strong>, with an immediate shortfall of <strong>$3.7 billion required within the next 10 years</strong>—all of it unfunded.</p>

  <p><em>You are free to pass this on.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Kind regards,</strong><br>
  Colin Jones<br>
  AREINZ<br>
  Director</p>

  <h2>⚖️ Compare and Contrast: Water-Based Rates vs. Flawed CCO Infrastructure Planning</h2>

  <h3>💡 Your Proposal: Targeted Water Metering → Usage-Based Rates</h3>
  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Begin with <strong>high-use water users</strong> (e.g. large commercial or industrial).</li>
    <li>Install <strong>meters at the head of each street</strong> to gather household-level consumption patterns.</li>
    <li>Provide <strong>usage data to all residents</strong>.</li>
    <li>Transition to a <strong>water usage-based rating system</strong>, replacing land-value based rates for water services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>✅ Pros</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User-pays model:</strong> Fairer system where people pay based on usage, not land size.</li>
    <li><strong>Demand-side transparency:</strong> Helps the public understand real usage patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost-efficiency:</strong> Prioritising big users and streets before individual homes lowers initial cost.</li>
    <li><strong>Behavioural impact:</strong> Encourages conservation and reduces waste.</li>
    <li><strong>Revenue predictability:</strong> Usage-based models can be more stable and scalable once fully implemented.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>❌ Cons / Challenges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Upfront investment</strong> in smart metering and data systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy and technical concerns</strong> over shared street-level data.</li>
    <li>Requires a <strong>phased rollout</strong> and public buy-in over several years.</li>
    <li>Not a full infrastructure solution—just part of the funding equation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🏗️ The CCO Approach (As Criticised by Colin Jones)</h3>
  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a separate <strong>Council-Controlled Organisation (CCO)</strong> to handle infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Use existing (and flawed) infrastructure planning methods.</li>
    <li>Finance infrastructure via <strong>massive borrowing—up to 500% of annual income</strong>.</li>
    <li>Add a new <strong>line to ratepayers' bills</strong> for infrastructure debt.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>✅ Claimed Benefits (from proponents)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>CCOs offer <strong>greater operational flexibility</strong> and faster delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Dedicated focus</strong> on infrastructure may improve prioritisation.</li>
    <li>Can <strong>separate political interference</strong> from long-term infrastructure planning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>❌ Risks / Criticism (from Jones)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Flawed assumptions and planning</strong> from past strategies are being repeated.</li>
    <li><strong>Debt ballooning:</strong> From 280% to 500% of income—an unsustainable fiscal model.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure deficit doubled</strong> from $12.5B (2021) to $28.5B (2025).</li>
    <li><strong>$3.7B shortfall</strong> in the next 10 years is unfunded.</li>
    <li><strong>Ratepayers will foot the bill</strong> without real reform or new revenue streams.</li>
    <li><strong>Line-item tax added</strong> without addressing root cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>
