<!-- DEBT FACTS -->
<section class="card" style="margin-top:18px" id="debt">
<h2>Hamilton’s Debt & Who We Owe</h2>
<p>Hamilton City debt is ~NZ$1.2–1.3B. Major channels include the LGFA (on-lending from bond markets), some direct bank facilities, and institutional investors who ultimately hold the paper. We publish it, then we shrink it. [oai_citation:11‡roderickjy.github.io](https://roderickjy.github.io/roderick-campaign-site/)</p>
<ul class="bullets">
<li>LGFA on-lends to councils; councils collectively guarantee each other’s debt. [oai_citation:12‡roderickjy.github.io](https://roderickjy.github.io/roderick-campaign-site/)</li>
<li>Historic bank loans may remain for cash-flow; LGFA usually cheaper/longer-dated. [oai_citation:13‡roderickjy.github.io](https://roderickjy.github.io/roderick-campaign-site/)</li>
<li>Bondholders: NZ Super, KiwiSaver funds, insurers, offshore pension/sovereign funds. [oai_citation:14‡roderickjy.github.io](https://roderickjy.github.io/roderick-campaign-site/)</li>

  <h2>Rebuilding Council Accountability: No to Lazy Politics, Yes to Structural Change</h2>
  <p><strong>Roderick J. Young — Candidate for Hamilton City Council (General Ward)</strong></p>

  <p>At the Glenview Community Centre meeting, I spoke directly against Tim’s proposal for rate caps mandated by central government. Leo also raised a valid point: rate capping is lazy politics. It gives a short-term soundbite but does nothing to fix the underlying issues in council spending and decision-making. As Maxine rightly noted, it’s <em>"lazy politics for lazy politicians."</em></p>

  <p>Hamilton’s real issue is not income—it’s management. As Colin Jones pointed out, Hamilton City Council (HCC) is <strong>technically insolvent</strong>, masked only by its ability to keep raising rates. Without that power, we’d be in the same boat as several UK and US cities that have defaulted on their debts.</p>

  <p>Colin is right: HCC has been papering over financial cracks for years. Developers are shown theoretical spreadsheets of "Development Contributions" (DCs), but the actual income is over $250 million short. Councillors are being fed rubbish information, left confused, and ultimately sidelined. The Audit Office? Asleep at the wheel for a decade.</p>

  <h3>From Staff-Led to Member-Led Governance</h3>

  <p>Mesh and I, over a simple cup of tea, discussed a structural fix:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Appoint three elected members to sit in on decisions between the CEO and senior department heads.
  </blockquote>

  <p>This committee would require <strong>two out of three sign-offs</strong> from elected representatives for decisions to proceed—especially anything involving public money or strategic direction. It’s a real-time audit of executive power, not a post-mortem.</p>

  <p>Let’s be honest: right now, staff can—and do—wait out councillors. Over the term of seven CEOs, we’ve seen a city budget balloon from <strong>$180 million to $1.22 billion</strong>. If council doesn’t assert control, nothing changes.</p>

  <p>This committee idea is how a new council gains back control. Not by trimming fat alone, but by restoring democratic oversight at the point of decision-making. I challenge the 12 mayoral candidates to say whether they support this reform. <strong>I’m happy to serve as the deputy mayor</strong> who helps make it real.</p>

  <h3>Rates, Productivity, and the Real Fix</h3>

  <p>While Rudi’s proposed 10% cuts across departments is one way to wake up the bureaucracy, my focus is on a <strong>34% city-wide increase in productivity</strong>—among council staff, businesses, and households alike.</p>

  <p>As the Binn Inn owner in Dinsdale told me:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “If my turnover increased by 34%, I could absorb rates going from $10,000 to $20,000. My fixed costs stay the same—turnover is everything.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is the kind of conversation we should be having: not short-term cuts or hollow caps, but economic uplift, efficiency, and better public service.</p>

  <h3>The Next 23 Days Matter</h3>

  <p>We have just <strong>23 days</strong> until polls close at <strong>12 noon on 11 October 2025</strong>. This election matters. It’s not just about the mayor—it’s about who you elect to the council table. We need strong, independent, and skilled voices willing to speak up <em>now</em>, not after the results are in.</p>

  <p>I invite the public and fellow candidates to attend the next public meetings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>5–7PM, Mondays: 22 & 29 September; 6, 13, and 20 October</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Victoria on the River, CBD</li>
    <li><strong>Details:</strong> <a href="https://roderickjy.github.io/roderick-campaign-site/kirk.html" target="_blank">Event page</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We cannot afford another three years of drift, confusion, and staff-led governance. It’s time for clear thinking, honest conversation, and democratic reform.</p>

  <p><strong>— Roderick J. Young</strong><br>
  Candidate for Hamilton City Council (General Ward)</p>
