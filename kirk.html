<section id="rebuilding-accountability" style="max-width: 720px; margin: 2rem auto; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; color: #111;">
  <h2>Rebuilding Council Accountability: No to Lazy Politics, Yes to Structural Change</h2>
  <p><strong>Roderick J. Young — Candidate for Hamilton City Council (General Ward)</strong></p>

  <p>At the Glenview Community Centre meeting, I spoke directly against Tim’s proposal for rate caps mandated by central government. Leo also raised a valid point: rate capping is lazy politics. It gives a short-term soundbite but does nothing to fix the underlying issues in council spending and decision-making. As Maxine rightly noted, it’s <em>"lazy politics for lazy politicians."</em></p>

  <p>Hamilton’s real issue is not income—it’s management. As Colin Jones pointed out, Hamilton City Council (HCC) is <strong>technically insolvent</strong>, masked only by its ability to keep raising rates. Without that power, we’d be in the same boat as several UK and US cities that have defaulted on their debts.</p>

  <p>Colin is right: HCC has been papering over financial cracks for years. Developers are shown theoretical spreadsheets of "Development Contributions" (DCs), but the actual income is over $250 million short. Councillors are being fed rubbish information, left confused, and ultimately sidelined. The Audit Office? Asleep at the wheel for a decade.</p>

  <h3>From Staff-Led to Member-Led Governance</h3>

  <p>Mesh and I, over a simple cup of tea, discussed a structural fix:</p>
  <blockquote>
    Appoint three elected members to sit in on decisions between the CEO and senior department heads.
  </blockquote>

  <p>This committee would require <strong>two out of three sign-offs</strong> from elected representatives for decisions to proceed—especially anything involving public money or strategic direction. It’s a real-time audit of executive power, not a post-mortem.</p>

  <p>Let’s be honest: right now, staff can—and do—wait out councillors. Over the term of seven CEOs, we’ve seen a city budget balloon from <strong>$180 million to $1.22 billion</strong>. If council doesn’t assert control, nothing changes.</p>

  <p>This committee idea is how a new council gains back control. Not by trimming fat alone, but by restoring democratic oversight at the point of decision-making. I challenge the 12 mayoral candidates to say whether they support this reform. <strong>I’m happy to serve as the deputy mayor</strong> who helps make it real.</p>

  <h3>Rates, Productivity, and the Real Fix</h3>

  <p>While Rudi’s proposed 10% cuts across departments is one way to wake up the bureaucracy, my focus is on a <strong>34% city-wide increase in productivity</strong>—among council staff, businesses, and households alike.</p>

  <p>As the Binn Inn owner in Dinsdale told me:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “If my turnover increased by 34%, I could absorb rates going from $10,000 to $20,000. My fixed costs stay the same—turnover is everything.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>This is the kind of conversation we should be having: not short-term cuts or hollow caps, but economic uplift, efficiency, and better public service.</p>

  <h3>The Next 23 Days Matter</h3>

  <p>We have just <strong>a few days</strong> until polls close at <strong>12 noon on 11 October 2025</strong>. This election matters. It’s not just about the mayor—it’s about who you elect to the council table. We need strong, independent, and skilled voices willing to speak up <em>now</em>, not after the results are in.</p>

  <p>I invite the public and fellow candidates to attend the next public meetings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>5–7PM, Mondays: 22 & 29 September; 6, 13, and 20 October</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Venue:</strong> Victoria on the River, CBD</li>
    <li><strong>Details:</strong> <a href="https://roderickjy.github.io/roderick-campaign-site/kirk.html" target="_blank">Event page</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We cannot afford another three years of drift, confusion, and staff-led governance. It’s time for clear thinking, honest conversation, and democratic reform.</p>

  Candidate for Hamilton City Council (General Ward)</p>

  <h3>Infrastructure and the New CCO: Concerns Raised</h3>
  <p><strong>From: Colin Jones, AREINZ<br>
  Director</strong></p>

  <p><em>Good morning all,</em></p>

  <p>I have reviewed most of the documentation for the new Council-Controlled Organisation (CCO). It is proposed to use the same <strong>“flawed” methodology</strong> for infrastructure planning that has caused many of HCC’s current problems.</p>

  <p>The only difference is that the <strong>debt will be 500% of income</strong>, compared to the 280% ratio HCC is currently using. There will also be a <strong>“separate line” in the rates bill</strong> specifically for infrastructure.</p>

  <p>The infrastructure deficit has increased dramatically, from <strong>$12.5 billion in 2021</strong> to approximately <strong>$28.5 billion in 2025</strong>, with an immediate shortfall of <strong>$3.7 billion required within the next 10 years</strong>—all of it unfunded.</p>

  <p><em>You are free to pass this on.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Kind regards,</strong><br>
  Colin Jones<br>
  AREINZ<br>
  Director</p>

  <h2>⚖️ Compare and Contrast: Water-Based Rates vs. Flawed CCO Infrastructure Planning</h2>

  <h3>💡 Your Proposal: Targeted Water Metering → Usage-Based Rates</h3>
  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Begin with <strong>high-use water users</strong> (e.g. large commercial or industrial).</li>
    <li>Install <strong>meters at the head of each street</strong> to gather household-level consumption patterns.</li>
    <li>Provide <strong>usage data to all residents</strong>.</li>
    <li>Transition to a <strong>water usage-based rating system</strong>, replacing land-value based rates for water services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>✅ Pros</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User-pays model:</strong> Fairer system where people pay based on usage, not land size.</li>
    <li><strong>Demand-side transparency:</strong> Helps the public understand real usage patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost-efficiency:</strong> Prioritising big users and streets before individual homes lowers initial cost.</li>
    <li><strong>Behavioural impact:</strong> Encourages conservation and reduces waste.</li>
    <li><strong>Revenue predictability:</strong> Usage-based models can be more stable and scalable once fully implemented.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>❌ Cons / Challenges</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Upfront investment</strong> in smart metering and data systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy and technical concerns</strong> over shared street-level data.</li>
    <li>Requires a <strong>phased rollout</strong> and public buy-in over several years.</li>
    <li>Not a full infrastructure solution—just part of the funding equation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🏗️ The CCO Approach (As Criticised by Colin Jones)</h3>
  <h4>Summary</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a separate <strong>Council-Controlled Organisation (CCO)</strong> to handle infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Use existing (and flawed) infrastructure planning methods.</li>
    <li>Finance infrastructure via <strong>massive borrowing—up to 500% of annual income</strong>.</li>
    <li>Add a new <strong>line to ratepayers' bills</strong> for infrastructure debt.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>✅ Claimed Benefits (from proponents)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>CCOs offer <strong>greater operational flexibility</strong> and faster delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Dedicated focus</strong> on infrastructure may improve prioritisation.</li>
    <li>Can <strong>separate political interference</strong> from long-term infrastructure planning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>❌ Risks / Criticism (from Jones)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Flawed assumptions and planning</strong> from past strategies are being repeated.</li>
    <li><strong>Debt ballooning:</strong> From 280% to 500% of income—an unsustainable fiscal model.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure deficit doubled</strong> from $12.5B (2021) to $28.5B (2025).</li>
    <li><strong>$3.7B shortfall</strong> in the next 10 years is unfunded.</li>
    <li><strong>Ratepayers will foot the bill</strong> without real reform or new revenue streams.</li>
    <li><strong>Line-item tax added</strong> without addressing root cost drivers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🧩 Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>water metering approach</strong> represents a <em>bottom-up, demand-side reform</em> that puts data in the hands of residents and introduces fairness through a usage-based model.
    In contrast, the <strong>CCO model</strong> doubles down on past planning failures, shifting risk and cost to the public through massive borrowing and new charges.
  </p>
  <p>
    If Hamilton is to solve its infrastructure challenges, <strong>financial accountability</strong> and <strong>behavioural change</strong> must be part of the solution—not just new borrowing vehicles with old problems.

  <h1>Hamilton City Infrastructure Ownership Proposal</h1>

  <p>If Hamilton City were to regain ownership of its electrical power infrastructure, telecommunications infrastructure (such as copper wires), and railway system including maintenance shops, these assets could offset rates, pay city bills, and foster employment and skills development.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. ⚡ Reclaiming Electrical Infrastructure</h2>
    <h3>Revenue Potential</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Electricity distribution generates steady cash flow through retail or lines company operations.</li>
      <li>Profits reinvested into the city rather than private shareholders.</li>
      <li>Potential establishment of a <em>Hamilton Power Trust</em> or similar public entity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Offsetting Rates</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Surplus profits subsidize general rates or reduce infrastructure levies.</li>
      <li>Funds community resilience projects (e.g., solar, EV infrastructure).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Employment & Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Jobs for maintenance crews, engineers, and customer service teams.</li>
      <li>Creation of apprenticeships and training in electrical and smart-grid technologies.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. 🌐 Regaining Telecommunications Infrastructure</h2>
    <h3>Revenue Potential</h3>
    <ul>

    <h2>📣 Final Thought</h2>
    <p>
      Restoring public ownership of key infrastructure is not just nostalgia—it’s a strategic response to economic stress, climate urgency, and democratic decline in local decision-making.<br />
      With courage and vision, Hamilton could build income through services, ease the rates burden, train its own skilled workforce, and become a model of sustainable municipal governance in New Zealand.
