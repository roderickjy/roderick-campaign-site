<h2>Act I — Super Saturday</h2>
<p><em>Victoria on the River. A chilly breeze. A voting box glows like the One Ring.</em></p>
<p><strong>CHORUS:</strong><br>
Behold, this box, where tick and hope do dwell,<br>
Where L-shaped lanes deliver final spell;<br>
Five thousand votes, and fifty hundred more,<br>
Shall tip the ship toward yon mayoral shore.</p>

<p><strong>RETURNING OFFICER (peering at screen):</strong><br>
Progress! List the ranks, the city breathes—<br>
Timus leads, then Sarah’s banner weaves.<br>
Yet mark: late scrolls from libraries and halls<br>
May turn the footnotes into curtain calls.</p>

<p><strong>TIMUS (entering):</strong><br>
Good folk, I thank thee—nay, I don’t get cocky;<br>
The CE’s rung—okay, I’m mayor. Shot, rocky! <em>(winks)</em><br>
Let not this chain grow heavy as a loan,<br>
But keep the budget’s temptings overthrown.</p>

<p><strong>BILLY T’S SPIRIT (aside):</strong><br>
He’s in, e hoa. Don’t muck about—<br>
Rates don’t pay themselves; nor potholes grout.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Act II — The Transfer Tango (STV)</h2>
<p><em>An abacus, a whiteboard. Names shuffle like cards.</em></p>
<p><strong>RETURNING OFFICER:</strong><br>
When mayor’s crown from East is plucked away,<br>
Her list must <strong>recompute</strong> this very day;<br>
Let second choices rise like cream on chai,<br>
And sixth-place dreams grow wings—or wave goodbye.</p>

<p><strong>RACHEL OF THE EAST:</strong><br>
If Tim steps up, then who steps into line?<br>
Let preferences, like arrows, find their sign.</p>

<p><strong>CHORUS (sings):</strong><br>
Count one, count two, then transfer aye to thee;<br>
S-T-V—<em>Some Truly Vexing</em>—alchemy!<br>
But patience, friends; the method’s made to show<br>
What most hearts hum beneath the first-vote glow.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Act III — The River Decides (Māori Ward Poll)</h2>
<p><em>A pou stands centre-stage. Two scrolls: KEEP and REMOVE.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARIA OF KIRIKIRIROA:</strong><br>
The river speaks, though barely by a creek:<br>
Thirteen-six keep the ward; thirteen-oh-ten seek<br>
To wipe it clean. Yet mandate there remains—<br>
A narrow bridge is still a bridge that stands.</p>

<p><strong>BILLY T’S SPIRIT:</strong><br>
Close as a kai bowl at the marae line—<br>
One more ladle and we’d be out o’ brine.</p>

<p><strong>CHORUS:</strong><br>
Take heed, new House: this margin thin and spare<br>
Demands good kōrero—and tika care.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Act IV — Westward! (and Eastward, too)</h2>
<p><em>A split stage: Frankton hums on the left; Chartwell blinks on the right.</em></p>
<p><strong>SARAH OF THE WEST:</strong><br>
Our boot-soles thin from doors and rain; still, look—<br>
The ledger lists our names within the book.<br>
Yet know, good mates, the middle’s tight and warm;<br>
Late votes may brew a last-night thunderstorm.</p>

<p><strong>ANGELA &amp; GEOFF (together):</strong><br>
Committees, then—let traffic, pipes, and parks<br>
Find budgets lit by lamps, not empty sparks.</p>

<p><strong>RACHEL / ANDREW / ANNA / LEO / JAMIE (alternating):</strong><br>
We count, recount, and bow to STV’s art—<br>
For sixth and seventh duel one narrowed heart.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Act V — The Chain and the Chalk</h2>
<p><em>Council chamber. A whiteboard titled “Rates • Debt • Basics”.</em></p>
<p><strong>TIMUS:</strong><br>
Now starts the graft—not headlines, nor the gloss:<br>
We prune the luxuries; we mind the cost.<br>
Yet fairness too—lest thrift become a noose,<br>
And civic trust slip loose from civic use.</p>

<p><strong>MARIA:</strong><br>
Remember also rivers, whenua, voice;<br>
Representation’s not a coin, but choice.</p>

<p><strong>BILLY T’S SPIRIT (to audience):</strong><br>
Alright, team—less opera, more doing.<br>
Fill the pothole, fix the looing.<br>
STV’s done its little dance;<br>
Now roll your sleeves—give pipes a chance.</p>

<p><strong>CHORUS (finale):</strong><br>
The votes are cast; the ledger near complete;<br>
Transfers yet hum beneath the city’s beat.<br>
A mayor stands; the ward’s retained with care—<br>
Now measure worth by mahi, not hot air.</p>

<p><em>Curtain.</em></p>
