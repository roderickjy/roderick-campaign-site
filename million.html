  <h1>Greater Hamilton: A No-Nonsense Path to One Million</h1>
  <p class="muted">A crisp roadmap to get “Greater Hamilton” (Hamilton City + Waikato + Waipā) to 1,000,000 people—while lifting incomes and liveability.</p>

  <h2>3 Phases, 12 Big Moves</h2>

  <div class="phase">
    <h3>Phase 1 (Now–2035): Lock in Fast Growth to ~300k City / ~500k Metro</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Supercharge our growth cells</strong> (Peacocke, Rotokauri, Ruakura, Rototuna).<br>
      Pre-consent & bulk-service whole neighbourhoods; release land in 50–100 ha tranches; deliver trunk pipes/roads once, housebuilders many times. Peacocke alone is part of Council’s program to add ~18,000 homes city-wide by 2035—push that higher with parallel delivery.</li>

      <li><strong>Back Ruakura Superhub as the jobs engine.</strong><br>
      Treat Ruakura as Hamilton’s “second CBD”: fast-track adjoining mixed-use and affordable apartments. Leverage the Tainui/Port of Tauranga JV for exporters and advanced manufacturing.</li>

      <li><strong>Make intercity rail and BRT unmissable.</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rail:</strong> Hourly (then half-hourly) Te Huia to Britomart via Pukekohe; aim for 70–80 min express with targeted upgrades.</li>
        <li><strong>City:</strong> Two Bus Rapid Transit spines with dedicated lanes and transit-oriented zoning.</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><strong>Exploit the Golden Triangle.</strong><br>
      Formal deal with Crown/Auckland/Tauranga: shared housing targets, rail capacity, and workforce pipelines.</li>

      <li><strong>Finish the connective tissue.</strong><br>
      Use the Waikato Expressway: reserve off-ramps for new town centres; protect transit corridors; open new Peacocke bridge area with mixed-use streets from day one.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="phase">
    <h3>Phase 2 (2035–2055): Scale to ~600k Metro, Densify the Core</h3>
    <ol start="6">
      <li><strong>Re-zone for “gentle density” everywhere.</strong><br>
      By-right duplex/terrace/4–6 storeys on transit corridors and near jobs/education. Use inclusionary housing tools to secure key worker/student units.</li>

      <li><strong>University + Innovation Park mega-precinct.</strong><br>
      Create a unified agritech–biotech–AI precinct linked by BRT and cycleways. Target 1,000+ research spinoffs in 20 years.</li>

      <li><strong>Water, power, and climate resilience at scale.</strong><br>
      Expand treatment/storage off the Waikato; electrify freight spine; mandate cool roofs, shade trees, and flood-ready grids.</li>

      <li><strong>Hamilton Civic/Infrastructure Bank.</strong><br>
      Fund with bonds and value-capture tools (targeted rates, special zones). Partner with iwi and NZ Super/ACC on long-term capital.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="phase">
    <h3>Phase 3 (2055–2085): The Million-Person Region</h3>
    <ol start="10">
      <li><strong>Master-plan satellite towns tied by fast rail.</strong><br>
      Grow Horotiu, Te Kauwhata, Ngāruawāhia, and Cambridge as 10–20 min rail towns with jobs, housing, and services.</li>

      <li><strong>A river city of great streets.</strong><br>
      Car-light CBD with parks, venues, and 24/7 housing; north–south cycle spine; nationally-recognised festival calendar.</li>

      <li><strong>Governance that matches the footprint.</strong><br>
      Form a “Greater Hamilton” combined authority with iwi partnership. One plan, one pipeline, one set of targets.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <hr>

  <h2>Targets & Reality Check</h2>
  <ul class="target-list">
    <li><strong>Housing:</strong> ~300,000 additional dwellings (mix of infill, greenfield, new towns).</li>
    <li><strong>Jobs:</strong> +300,000–400,000 across logistics, science, manufacturing, education, and services.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> 40–50% of peak trips by transit/walk/bike in the urban core.</li>
    <li><strong>Population headwinds:</strong> NZ is losing citizens; Hamilton must be the arrival city: fast approvals, vibrant CBD, rentals, and employer-led immigration.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>First 10 Actions in the Next 24 Months</h2>
  <ol class="actions">
    <li>Pre-consent 20k lots across Peacocke, Rotokauri, and Ruakura with trunk infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Lock a Golden Triangle City Deal (Crown, councils, iwi, ports) for rail, jobs, and housing.</li>
    <li>Convert two bus corridors to BRT with dedicated lanes and priority.</li>
    <li>Negotiate Te Huia upgrades (reliability, frequency, travel time).</li>
    <li>Re-zone transit corridors for mid-rise with affordable housing bonuses.</li>
    <li>Stand up a Hamilton Civic/Infrastructure Bank and publish a 30-year bond programme.</li>
    <li>Launch the Ruakura–University Innovation Precinct with lab/office pilots and a venture studio.</li>
    <li>Publish a Water & Energy Plan aligned to the million-person future.</li>
    <li>Create a one-stop consenting concierge for major employers and build-to-rent developers.</li>
    <li>Brand Hamilton globally as NZ’s inland capital: fast freight, affordable living, serious science.</li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <p><strong>Hamilton won’t hit a million by accident.</strong> It takes a megaregion mindset, relentless housing supply, and rail-anchored urbanism—built on real assets we already have: Ruakura, the expressway, Te Huia, and growth-ready land.</p>
